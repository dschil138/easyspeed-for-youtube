A Chrome extension that lets you click and drag anywhere on a Youtube video to adjust the playback speed.

Click and hold for 2x. When the click is released, it will go back to regular playback. To play at faster speeds, like 3x or 10x, drag your click to the right. For slower speeds, drag to the left.

Drag all the way left to rewind.

For any of these speeds, when the click is released, the video will resume playing at its regular speed. 

If you want to set the new speed to continue after the click is released, simply drag the click down before releasing.

Very helpful for quickly skimming sections of a video you are not interested in, without having to open the settings menu and select speed from there. And no need to reopen it again to set it back to normal when your done!
