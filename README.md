#### Available in the [Chrome Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/easyspeed-for-youtube/lmcggcabhocpfkbddekmconplfjmmgmn)
A Chrome extension that lets you click and drag left/right on a Youtube video to adjust the playback speed.

Very helpful for quickly skimming sections of a video you are not interested in, or just changing the speed without having to navigate the settings menu.


## Selecting a Speed


Click and hold for 2x. When the click is released, it will go back to regular playback.

For faster playback speeds, like 3x or 10x, drag your click to the right. For slower speeds, like 1.5x or 0.75x drag to the left. 

All these speeds can be changed in the settings.

Drag all the way left to rewind.

## Temporary Change vs Persistent

By default, the video will resume playing at its regular speed when the click is released.

If you want to set the new speed to persist even after you let go of the click, simply drag the click down before releasing.

The indictaor at the top will turn bold to let you know that you've set that as the new playback speed.
